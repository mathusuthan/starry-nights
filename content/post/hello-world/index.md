Welcome to my blog! I'm Mathusuthan, a Data Scientist working in the dynamic world of Data Science and AI Engineering â€“ or whatever the latest term is for those of us who dive deep into the realms of Data, Analytics, and Machine Learning.

I started this blog after a long break due to a surgery. I am back searching for jobs and am trying to post some random stuff and projects that I worked on. After all building stuff is what I like, not interviewing :-)

Along the way, if this helps someone, that would be great.
