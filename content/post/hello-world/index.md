Welcome to my blog! I'm Mathusuthan, nestled in the dynamic world of Data Science and AI Engineering â€“ or whatever the latest term is for those of us who dive deep into the realms of Data, Analytics, and Machine Learning.

In this blog, you'll find a treasure trove of insights and notes that helped me through the early and often frustrating days of my career. Here, I hope I'll unravel some of the 'mysteries' in Applied Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Generative AI, MLOps, and Data Engineering.

I hope this blog is helpful for both newcomers to the field and to seasoned practitioners alike.

Whether you're taking your first steps into the vast universe of data science or you're here to refine your craft, I hope this blog serves as a helpful guide. I hope we can learn from each other, so please do not hesitate to contact me in case you need anything specific or you find anything amiss.
