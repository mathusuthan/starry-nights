[{"content":"Welcome to my blog! I\u0026rsquo;m Mathusuthan, a Data Scientist working in the dynamic world of Data Science and AI Engineering â€“ or whatever the latest term is for those of us who dive deep into the realms of Data, Analytics, and Machine Learning.\nI started this blog after a long break due to a surgery. I am back searching for jobs and am trying to post some random stuff and projects that I worked on. After all building stuff is what I like, not interviewing :-)\nAlong the way, if this helps someone, that would be great.\nCover image \u0026ldquo;Starry Nights with a modern twist\u0026rdquo; generated by DALL-E\n","date":"2024-09-03T10:00:00+05:30","image":"https://mathusuthan.com/p/hello-world/cover_hu10681498957206153700.jpg","permalink":"https://mathusuthan.com/p/hello-world/","title":"Hello everyone"}]
